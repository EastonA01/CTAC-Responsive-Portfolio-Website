        <h2>CTAC Project: ChatGPT to The Rescue</h2>
        <p>Inside this particular assignement we were tasked with understanding proper queries with
            large language models such as ChatGPT. We were to formulate a query to give to ChatGPT, record
            both our query and the response- reflect on the input and output and see how we can improve our
            queries to get better responses.

        <h2>CTAC Project: Group Github Assignment</h2>
        <p>The first of many group assignments- we were tasked with coordinating a group
            README file where each team member attached some details on themselves and performed the
            necessary steps using Git to prevent merge conflicts with the other commits made by 
            additional members.
